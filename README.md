# HackAssembler
 A Hack computer Assembler made in Python

To translate a code into machine language use this command:

`python Assembler.py myAsmFile.asm`

For now, the Assembler will output a default file named `output.hack`. So, compiling a new .asm file without moving the old one, will overwrite it.
